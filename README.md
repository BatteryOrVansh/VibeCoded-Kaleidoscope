this trippy kaleidoscope thing i made ðŸŒ€
soooo i made this thing.

it's basically a digital kaleidoscope. you just move your mouse and it makes all these sick symmetrical patterns. kinda mesmerizing tbh.

Gemini helped me code it up, which is pretty cool.

what's it running on?
HTML: duh, just the basic page.

Tailwind CSS: to make the buttons and stuff not look like total garbage.

p5.js: this is where the magic happens. it's a js library that does all the heavy lifting for the drawing. the real MVP.

how the heck does it work?
the whole kaleidoscope effect is just a few simple tricks stacked together:

translate(width / 2, height / 2): first it moves the (0,0) point to the middle of the screen. so everything starts from the center.

rotate(angle): then it just spins the canvas around and around.

line(mx, my, pmx, pmy): this just draws a line wherever your mouse goes. simple.

scale(1, -1): ok this is the secret sauce. it flips the drawing upside down to make a mirror image. so it draws your line, then draws the flipped version, and that's what makes the crazy patterns. lol.

wanna make your own?
